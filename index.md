<h2><strong>Exciting Cards</strong></h2>
The Fantasy Physics demo includes over ### cards representing real-life experiments, techniques, and phenomena involved 
in the cutting edge of experimental high energy physics research. 
<br><br>
New cards will be periodically released in free expansion packs as we move through the demo period towards the 1.0 release.

<h2><strong>Emergent Synergies</strong></h2>
What if you built a nuclear reactor above the IceCube facility? What if you trained a neural network with the resources 
of the LHC computing grid? What if you fired the LBNF neutrino beam at the Super-Kamiokande detector? 
<br><br>
Cards are designed to work together in surprising and complex ways that give interesting, scientifically-plausible 
answers to these hypotheticals and more.

<h2><strong>Real Physics</strong></h2>
Every card, token, and effect was designed by real physicists with an eye towards accurately representing 
the science at play, and each gamepiece has a corresponding webpage describing the science behind the cards.
