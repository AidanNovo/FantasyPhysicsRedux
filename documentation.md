# Fantasy Physics Documentation

## Introduction
Hello, whoever may be reading this. This is the (still very much work-in-progress) documentation for my Fantasy Physics project. The purpose of this project is to be a engine-building game similar to Balatro, Nubby's Number Factory, CloverPit, etc. where you build out a particle physics experiment using cards representing real pieces of the experimental HEP world.

The main purpose of this _document_ is to outline the basic structure of my code in order to make extending/maintaining my work more feasible.

## Structure
This code has 
- GUI layer
- Card/Token Dict
- Engine
- Observers
