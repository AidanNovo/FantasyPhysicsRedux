This is where all the cards go.
I am imagining a bunch of floating card images that you can click on
in order to go to the cards' pages.

This also should maybe not be a markdown formatted page.
Look into the ways that some themes do those portfolio pages!

**Card Page Directory (temporary)**
* [IceCube]({{ 'cards/icecube' | relative_url}})
* [Super-Kamiokande]({{ 'cards/super_k' | relative_url}})

Also, ideally this whole thing would be automatically-populated, which will surely be easy to do.
