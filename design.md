## General Brainstorming

If I really want the GUI to be more responsive, I should implement some multiprocessing

Ideas for additional cards
I think there are a handful of areas I can develop cards in
- More 'core' cards——detectors, sources, and analysis
- Objective cards——big overall theme stuff, maybe sort of like MTG color pie?
- Auxiliary cards——little 'extra' cards for people to slot in that do more unique things

What if data storage is a thing? Like you have a certain max amount of data?
- Inspired by CERN's many issues with long-term data storage
- Analysis doesn't really use up your data, though...
  - Maybe some analysis cards can _refine_ your data? Like, reduce your total data amount by half but also gain a multiplier to its efficacy?

For aesthetic reasons at the very _least_, neutrino flux should be high but neutrino detectors convert flux to data inefficiently

The core question I am asking for everything is:
"How is this experiment/detector/analysis method different from others?"



## Card Design Elements

The card design needs all of the following:
- Card name
- Card type
- Card tags
- Card image
- Mechanic description (get templating)
- Outreach flavor text
- Card level?
- Card rarity marker?
