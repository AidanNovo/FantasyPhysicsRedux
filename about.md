## **Fantasy Physics**

Fantasy Physics is a physics outreach project developed at the University of Kansas's [Department of Physics & Astronomy](https://physics.ku.edu/)
and aimed at getting late high school and early college physics students interested in the cutting edge of experimental
high energy physics. 

Inspired by popular card and video games including _Balatro_, _Nubby's Number Factory_, and _Magic: The Gathering_, 
Fantasy Physics is an [open-source](https://github.com/AidanNovo/FantasyPhysicsRedux) game in which players assemble a 
modern particle physics experiment out of components of existing experiments, detectors, and techniques, each
represented by a [collectable card]({{ 'cards/' | relative_url}}). This website includes high-resolution images of each 
card alongside more detailed descriptions of the physics at play, as well as helpful links to experiment homepages to 
serve as a launchpad for interested students to learn more.

Originally conceived in 2018 by Professor Christopher Rogan, the project was revived in 2024 under a new design vision 
proposed by Aidan Novo.

Dr. Rogan's blurb goes here. Can probably at least base it off of the description from the old fantasy physics site.

Should Dr. Brunetti have a blurb? Talk to Dr. Rogan about this.
