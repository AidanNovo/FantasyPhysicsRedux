## **Fantasy Physics**

Fantasy Physics is a physics outreach project developed at the University of Kansas's [Department of Physics & Astronomy](https://physics.ku.edu/)
and aimed at getting late high school and early college physics students interested in the cutting edge of experimental
high energy physics. 

Inspired by popular card and video games including _Balatro_, _Nubby's Number Factory_, and _Magic: The Gathering_, 
Fantasy Physics is an [open-source](https://github.com/AidanNovo/FantasyPhysicsRedux) game in which players assemble a 
modern particle physics experiment out of components of existing experiments, detectors, and techniques, each
represented by a [collectable card]({{ 'cards/' | relative_url}}). This website includes high-resolution images of each 
card alongside more detailed descriptions of the physics at play, as well as helpful links to experiment homepages to 
serve as a launchpad for interested students to learn more.

Originally conceived in 2018 by Professor Christopher Rogan, the project evolved into its current form in 2024 under a 
new design vision proposed by Aidan Novo.
