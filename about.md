Fantasy Physics is a physics outreach project developed at the University of Kansas's [Department of Physics & Astronomy](https://physics.ku.edu/)
and aimed at getting late high school and early college physics students interested in the cutting edge of experimental
high energy physics. 

Inspired by popular card and video games including _Balatro_, _Nubby's Number Factory_, and _Magic: The Gathering_, 
Fantasy Physics is an [open-source](https://github.com/AidanNovo/FantasyPhysicsRedux) game in which players assemble a 
modern particle physics experiment out of components of existing experiments, detectors, and techniques, each
represented by a [collectable card]({{ 'cards/' | relative_url}}). This website includes high-resolution images of each 
card alongside more detailed descriptions of the physics at play, as well as helpful links to experiment homepages to 
serve as a launchpad for interested students to learn more.

Originally conceived in 2018 by Professor Christopher Rogan, the project was revived in 2024 under a new design vision 
proposed by Aidan Novo.

## **The Creators**

### _Dr. Christopher Rogan_

Dr. Rogan's blurb goes here. Can probably at least base it off of the description from the old fantasy physics site.

### _Dr. Maria Brunetti_

Should Dr. Brunetti have a blurb? Talk to Dr. Rogan about this.

### _Aidan Novo_

Aidan Novo is a 5th-year undergraduate student at the University of Kansas, dual-majoring in Physics and Classics.
He is also a member of the University Honors Program, serves in the student government body for his on-campus housing,
and works as a research assistant under Dr. Christopher Rogan as part of the University's Experimental High Energy
Physics group.

He has served as the primary developer, graphic designer, and creative lead for the Fantasy Physics project since its 
revival in 2024.

### _Paige Trevarrow_

Paige Trevarrow is a ...

(The rest of the Paige blurb goes here. Should probably have her write it.)
