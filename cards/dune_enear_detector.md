## **DETECTOR // Neutrino** 
### _Uncommon_

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a real-life neutrino detector experiment located in Antarctica.
IceCube is made up of a collection of strings deployed into deep holes (up to 2.4 kilometers, taller than 7 Eiffel towers) 
drilled in the Antarctic ice. On each string are a series of detectors known as digital optical modules, or DOMs, which
watch for the flashes of light sometimes produced when neutrinos pass through the ice. Altogether, IceCube is made up of
5,160 DOMs, all waiting to detect an incoming neutrino.
